This project is from a tutorial of NextJS 14.

The aim of this is to learn NextJS 14 features. For sake of simplicity using regular JavaScript. 
I hope to make this a reference piece to myself or others or a sandbox to try new things. 


This is Maximillian Schwarzmuller course.

## The find method:
The find method in JavaScript is used to search for and return the first element in an array that satisfies a provided testing function. If no elements satisfy the testing function, find returns undefined.

Here we use it to match the params of the slug in our `dummy-news` file. It will return the first element that is matching slug 
and we can use that object.
